This site is intended to lower the learning curve for newcomers to PICSL.  It includes information on how to use the cluster safely and politely.  In addition, it gives a quick overview of some of the lab's most commonly used software.  A more comprehensive list of software can be found at the [PICSL website](http://picsl.upenn.edu/tag/software/).
