## Lab Meetings
Lab meetings are on Fridays at 12:00 in the conference room in 370.  Lab members take turns presenting data. 


## Conferences
Unlike most academic fields, computer science conferences are the primary source of disseminating computer science research.  Acceptance rates at the top conferences are quite competitive (~25%) and are on par with journals in the field.  The most relevant CS-type conferences for PICSL research are: 

1. [MICCAI](http://www.miccai.org):  This conference focuses on medical image analysis methodology, although they try to make room for interesting applications.  MICCAI is the standard conference in the field of medical image analysis, and is a pretty safe bet if you don't know where to submit.  Deadlines is on or about March 1st, and the conference is in mid-September. 
2. [CVPR](http://www.pamitc.org/cvpr14) is the premier computer vision conference.  It's more technically focused than MICCAI, and medical image analysis is a much smaller component of the program.  Submissions to CVPR should ideally be interesting to the broader computer vision technology community (photo search, object recognition, etc.).  Submission deadline is in November, and the conference is late June. 
3. [IPMI](http://ipmi2013.ipmi-conference.org/) is a biennial conference in medical image analysis.  It aims to be more mathematically inclined than MICCAI.  The conference is intentionally quite small (~100 attendees), and is a great way for trainees to meet more senior people in the field. Submission deadline is the end of December, and conference is late June. 

Submissions to these conferences are in the form of a paper (roughly 1/2-2/3 the length of a regular journal article).  Besides these conferences, some more scientifically oriented conferences include: 
4. [ISMRM](www.ismrm.org): Focused on MRI.  A huge conference, with a good representation of both clinicians and scientists.  Deadline is November, with conference mid-May.
5. [HBM](http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/):  Covers all aspects of neuroimaging.  Quite large.  Deadline is early January, with the conference over the summer.
